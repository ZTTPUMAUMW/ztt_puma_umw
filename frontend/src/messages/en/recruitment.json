If research is your passion - we'll find a place for you on board.",
    "internshipContent": "Do you have an idea that others would consider too difficult or too bold? Welcome. At P.U.M.A., we don't run from challenges - we turn them into projects, data, patents and publications you can participate in. If you want to do more than just collect points for your CV, you'll find partners here who will not only listen to you and help you get started, but will also support you in both daily scientific inquiries and struggles with bureaucracy.",
    "phdContent": "If your motivation is an easy doctoral degree, three other jobs, and a symbolic visit to the lab every other Thursday between 1:07 PM and 1:15 PM - look elsewhere. A PhD at P.U.M.A. is an adventure that requires determination and consistency. In return, you'll get the opportunity to work on projects of real significance, support from specialists from around the world, and a chance to publish in recognized journals. Ideally, you're genuinely passionate about what you do and want to do - then we'll do everything to help you."
